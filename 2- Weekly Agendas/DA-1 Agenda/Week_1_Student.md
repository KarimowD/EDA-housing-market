- Personal Questions 
- Any challenges (Classes, Coding, studying, etc.) 
- How you’re studying? Do you need personal advice? 
- Remember that practice makes perfect. 
- What exactly do each student do for the team, if they know each other, if they care for each other, if they follow and talk with each other etc?

(The problems and subjects in this part, have been prepared especially for you to equip yourself for the interview process and improve your coding skills. 
To get the most from this part, it’s highly recommended to be prepared and present the topics in English/German.
We strongly suggest that you force yourself to present especially the interview questions in English/German. 
This part's main and only aim is to develop the skills you need during and after the recruitment process and prepare you for the ML career.)

<h3><strong>Flipgrid Quastions</strong></h4>

**1-Statistics ~ Data Science**
<p>Statistics consists of methods for conducting research studies and for analyzing and interpreting the data produced by those studies. Statistics is the art and science of learning from data . Data science provides meaningful information based on large amounts of complex data or big data. Data science, or data-driven science, combines different fields of work in statistics and computation to interpret data for decision-making purposes.

Many statisticians have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data. Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action.</p>
